# 🐱⌨️ Shortcat 
A lightweight, open-source tool to resolve hotkey conflicts across macOS/Windows apps. Intercept, reroute, and prioritize shortcuts dynamically – like a clever cat guiding keystrokes to their right targets. 🐱⌨️

*(Currently incubating 🥚 → 🐣 → 🐈⬛)*

**The Problem**

Raycast `⌥ + Space` wants it for launcher,  
uTools `⌥ + Space` for super-search,  
ChatGPT `⌥ + Space` for quick access.  
**Your Mac?** It just wants peace.  

Shortcat is the UN peacekeeper for your keyboard.

## **The Solution**  
Shortcat is a:  
🕶️ **Keyboard Referee** - Intercepts conflicting hotkeys  
🗺️ **Shortcut GPS** - Routes keystrokes to target apps  
🐾 **Silent Observer** - Works without hogging your RAM

**"Shortcuts should serve you,<br>
not your apps' territorial disputes."**
